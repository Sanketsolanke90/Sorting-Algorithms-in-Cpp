# Sorting Algorithms in C++

🚀 A collection of popular sorting algorithm implementations in **C++**, written with clean code, comments, and structured modular functions.

---

## 📌 Features
- Implemented **five sorting algorithms**:
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Bubble Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
- Well-structured, modular code
- Detailed comments for better understanding
- Easy to extend and experiment with
- Beginner-friendly (good for DSA practice)

## 🛠 Algorithms & Time Complexity

| Algorithm        | Best Case | Average Case | Worst Case | Space Complexity |
|------------------|-----------|--------------|------------|------------------|
| **Selection Sort** | O(n²)    | O(n²)        | O(n²)      | O(1)             |
| **Insertion Sort** | O(n)     | O(n²)        | O(n²)      | O(1)             |
| **Bubble Sort**    | O(n)     | O(n²)        | O(n²)      | O(1)             |
| **Merge Sort**     | O(n log n) | O(n log n) | O(n log n) | O(n)             |
| **Quick Sort**     | O(n log n) | O(n log n) | O(n²)      | O(log n)         |

## 📊 Sample Output

```text
Original Array: 1 4 2 4 3 5 6 4 6
Sorted Array:   1 2 3 4 4 4 5 6 6
```

## 💡 Future Improvements

* Add more algorithms (Heap Sort, Counting Sort, Radix Sort)
* Provide interactive menu for user selection
* Compare performance of all algorithms
